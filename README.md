# Overflow Slider

This is slider library that is based on CSS overflow and progressive enhancements via JavaScript. The library is written in TypeScript but it requires no dependencies.

This library is heavily inspired by [Keen Slider](https://keen-slider.io/) and provides somewhat similar programming interface but with different engine running under the hood – CSS overflow.

Overflow Slider aims to be lightweight, mobile-first and accessible. It is designed to be used in modern web projects and is very customizable and extendable via plugins and CSS.

## Demos

* [Example and demos](https://evermade.github.io/overflow-slider/)

### Usage

Markup:

```html
<div class="overflow-slider">
	<div>Slide 1</div>
	<div>Slide 2</div>
	<div>Slide 3</div>
</div>
```

You don't have to use even class `overflow-slider` and slides can be whatever elements like `<a>`, `<li>`, or `article`.

If you’re using a bundler (such as Webpack or Rollup), you can install through npm:

```bash
npm install @evermade/oveflow-slider
```

Import the `OverflowSlider` along with plugins you want to use.

```js
import {
	OverflowSlider,
	DragScrollingPlugin,
	SkipLinksPlugin,
	ArrowsPlugin,
	ScrollIndicatorPlugin,
	DotsPlugin
} from "@evermade/overflow-slider";

// minimal example
const minimalSlider = new OverflowSlider(
	document.querySelector( '.slider-container-here' ),
);

// example with plugins
const slider = new OverflowSlider(
	document.querySelector( '.slider-container-here' ),
	{
		// options here
	},
	[
		DragScrollingPlugin(),
		ArrowsPlugin(),
		ScrollIndicatorPlugin(),
		DotsPlugin(),
		SkipLinksPlugin(),
	]
);

// note that many plugins have their own settings so you can pass them as an object

const slider = new OverflowSlider(
	document.querySelector( '.slider-container-here' ),
	{
		// options here
	},
	[
		ArrowsPlugin({
			texts: {
				buttonPrevious: 'Previous',
				buttonNext: 'Next',
			},
			icons: {
				prev: '<svg>...</svg>',
				next: '<svg>...</svg>',
			},
			classNames: {
				navContainer: 'my-nav-container',
				prevButton: 'my-prev-button',
				nextButton: 'my-next-button',
			},
			container: document.querySelector( '.my-nav-container' ),
		}),
	]
);

```

### Styles

You can import base styles from the library to get started. The base styles include basic styles for the slider and some plugins.

```scss
@import "@evermade/overflow-slider/dist/overflow-slider.css";
```

You can use the CSS variables to override some values easily.

Note that you can easily write styles from scratch if you want to. See source code from `src/overflow-slider.scss` for reference.

## Known issues

### Drag Scrolling and Firefox

Drag scrolling does not work very well in Firefox when slides are clikable. We are working on a fix for this if that is possible.

## Limitations

### Vertical scrolling

The library is designed to work with horizontal scrolling. Vertical scrolling is not supported and likely never will because it is not a common use case for sliders.

### RTL support

RTL support is not implemented yet. In case need arises it can be implemented but requires changes to the core and plugins.

### Looping slides

Looping slides is not supported and likely never will be. It is a feature that is not very common and it is not very accessible.

### Auto-play

Auto-play is not supported at the moment but can probably be implemented as a plugin. It is not very accessible and should be avoided if possible.
